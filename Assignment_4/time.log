10/22  08:00am  2:00  revised the getVector fucntion in calculating each single value inside
					  the vector since I misunderstood the required ratio meaning; passed the
					  basic sample testcase; initialed the public function comments.
10/23  02:00pm  2:00  fixed a bug when dealing with the case where the keyword never appeared to avoid case of divided by zero;
					  passed the two online test cases, working on the time log.

I discussed my solution with: No one

The idea of this assignment was to design and implement a data structure to store all keywords and the matrix with an easy and ordered method on accessing. I decided to use a hash map along with a 2 dimensional vector to store those information where the key of the
hash map is keyword itself while the value is its order.
The difficult of this assignment is how to read current line from the text, I choose to use getline() function in the readContext, and once the input stream is empty or it has reached EOF which is the end of the text, my readContext function would throw an exception with the string “completed reading action” to denote the reading is done. In this case, please notice to catch this exception if new main function was built for test.

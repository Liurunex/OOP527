I discussed my solution with: No one

The idea of this assignment was to design and implement the game object using inheritance, polymorphism and factory;
Converting the original SpinOut and Conway classes into inheritances of Puzzle base class is straightforward, the
difficult part was how to properly implement the factory feature and construct the Puzzle_Move class object. Here I
used a vector as a class member of Puzzle_Move and stored the move coordinates inside. A minior notice is that in my
readMove fucntion, it will check the case if the input is not completed, and will return a nullptr if the input is
incomplted. My fucntion also only throw exception is the build method is not correct

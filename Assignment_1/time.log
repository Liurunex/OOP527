I discussed my solution with: No one

The idea of this assignment is to use getline and isstringstream to split the input,
then convert those splited string tokens into double and combine them into the 
corresponding double value by using stod function, finally we did the formula caculations
to get the answer. 
Checking the invalid input was difficult since some cases were not easy to implement 
the handler. Using the stod function helped on solving this issue, as the stod 
fucntion will throw exception that can be catched and it provided the pointer to 
the next position in string after converting the string into double, which is 
greatly helpful on detecting invalid input like the string mixed both character
and digit. Another problem was the empty input line case, I finally found the function
called find_first_not_of() of string to solve this issue.

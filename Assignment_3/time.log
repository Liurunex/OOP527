I discussed my solution with: No one

The idea of this assignment is to build the game object based on the argument input, choose the suitable
constructor and correct play mode. The constructor itself will check the input arguments and initial the game
board. The process of both interactive mode and non-interactive mode is similar: using a while loop and
check some corner cases.
The difficulty of this assignment is how to read from file and how to  handle all illegal inputs in a
graceful way, how to avoid segmentation fault or infinite loop. I spent much time on understanding left value
and right value, learning the move constructor and assignment opeartor. Although writing the code of this part
is not hard, but to get a correct understanding of why and when to use move semantics is kind of difficult for
me. The other challenge is to deal with file input and read from itream. With the help with the c++ library, I
finally solved this problem in a easy way.

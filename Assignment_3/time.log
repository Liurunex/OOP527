I discussed my solution with: No one

The idea of this assignment is to build the game object based on the argument input, choose the suitable
constructor and correct play mode. The constructor itself will check the input arguments and initial the game
board. The process of both interactive mode and non-interactive mode is similar: using a do-while loop and
check some corner cases. 
The difficulty of this assignment is how to handle all illegal inputs in a graceful way, how to avoid
segmentation fault or infinite loop. I misunderstood the way of handling illegal cases as I started working 
on the assignment when it was still a draft. Therefore I didnâ€™t notice some requirement has been changed 
until the few days before deadline. Fortunately, I finally get the correct concept of the assignment and 
revise my constructor so that it now could handle the illegal parameters. I also revise my main function to
remove the valid input checking process and put all those stuff into my SpinOut class function members.

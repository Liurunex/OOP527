I discussed my solution with: No one

The idea of this assignment was to implement a new game named fission. Here I build a board class
derived from base board, a piece class derived from base piece class, and a light piece class derived from the
former piece class I just built. The trikcy part of this assignment is how to determine which piece should be
removed from the board when the hit happened. I implement this hit function inside my piece subclass so that once
a piece hit another, the hit fucntion inside the piece will be called to remove those pieces. Another challenage
is HTML output, I fixed it by comparing with the sample output.

I discussed my solution with: No one

The idea of this assignment was to refactor the game class. Here I built two base class of baord and 
piece respectively. My idea is to build the base abstract class which is inherited by real game board and peices.
The tricky part of this is how to deal with the base class member to be consistent with the child class memeber,
and decide which part to be implemented in base class so that we can build another game based on the base class 
with minial code. I made some code in the base class with implementation to acheive that purpose and it worked well.
